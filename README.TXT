PROJECT TITLE: Genetic Algorithm A.I
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Using Genetic Algorithm find a key string from a string of random characters. Various Genetic Algorithm methods implemented and can be used with minor edits in the code.
VERSION or DATE: 11/23/2020
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: The test showing the impacts of the various parameters are commented out.
AUTHORS: Lyndbergh Simelus
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Create a GA object. Run the varCheack to make sure the inputs are correct. Run train to run the algorithm.
